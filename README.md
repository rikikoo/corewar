# corewar
a mini-assembler and a VM that executes bytecode generated by that assembler

VM made by [rikikoo](https://github.com/rikikoo)


In this "final" 42 school's group project the goal is to replicate perfectly the behaivor of the binaries `asm` and `corewar`.
Apparently the `corewar` binary is based on an 80s "programming game" [Core War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War).
Just like in the original game, the VM places player-written programs in its memory and lets them try to fill the memory and "stay alive", until certain conditions have been met.


Usually the _subject_ of a project, a.k.a. the project description provided to the students by the school, have clearly defined requirements what needs to be accomplished.
This time though, the school intentionally has made the subject nearly incomprehensible.
There are clues and some useful info which help, but most of the work in the completion of this project is getting your head around the inner workings of the two provided binaries.


The students are provided with the executables (`resources/asm` and `resources/corewar`), a header file (`resources/op.h`) and a source file (`resources/op.c`).
The latter two are explained later.

# asm
`asm` is an assembler. It takes a `.s` file as an argument and produces a `.cor` file to the same directory the `.s` file was in.
The `.s` files are text files that have syntax inside them that has a very close resemblance to the assembly language.
`asm` parses the `.s` file contents and like with any language, the syntax is strict and an error is produced if the syntax is invalid.
If the syntax is valid, a byte code file `.cor` is written out. This byte code has a specific structure, which the VM `corewar` executes.
One `.cor` file represents a _champion_ that will battle with other champions in the Virtual Machine.
